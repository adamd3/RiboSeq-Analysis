November 2017.

Outline:
  - Quality assessment of reads.
  - Trim reads.
  - Map sequentially to rRNA; vRNA; mRNA; ncRNA; host genome.
  - Plot the read mapping statistics.
  - Calculate the length distribution of reads + plot
  - Calculate framing of reads on host mRNA transcripts + plot
  - Assess contamination of samples by ribonucleoproteins (RNPs)
